/**
 * Shared Scaffold Delivery Contracts
 * @version 1.4.0
 *
 * v1.4.0: PlatformProfile's 'both' renamed to 'all' and its delivery-derivation
 * meaning expanded to include the codex platform (CODEX.md/.codex/), matching
 * the same rename in new-project.ts/upgrade-project.ts/test-new-project.ts —
 * this module's docstring says it mirrors new-project's delivery logic, so it
 * must stay in lockstep or simulate-pipeline's dry-run predictions drift from
 * real scaffold output.
 * v1.3.0 (T-20260916-001): TRANSIENT_TEST_FIXTURE_PREFIXES +
 * isTransientTestFixture — the shared name predicate that lets
 * templates/-scanning validators skip E2E staging dirs
 * (test-l3promo-*, co-e2eguard-*, co-e2p2*) while they exist. The E2E
 * (test-l3-to-variant-promotion.ts) derives its fixture names from the
 * same constants, so producer and skipper cannot drift.
 *
 * v1.2.0 (T-20260916-010): variant templates stopped shipping a stub
 * docs/VERSION_MANIFEST.md (validate-templates `variant-version-manifest`
 * arm retires the stub class); the full generated manifest is scaffold-owned.
 * This module carries the relpath constants and the pure invoke-decision
 * helper the scaffold (new-project.ts §7.8) and the upgrade flow
 * (upgrade-project.ts post-upgrade regeneration) share, so "which file is
 * generated, and what does the generator need to exist" cannot drift between
 * the two delivery paths.
 *
 * v1.1.0 (T-20260915-012 / M12): NEW_PROJECT_L1_ONLY_AGENTS dropped stale
 * entries (`agents/lifecycle-manager.md`, `agents/pm.md.backup` — neither
 * exists under templates/common/, so the exclusions were dead and masked
 * future drift); only the resolving entry `agents/_COMMON.md` remains, and
 * a unit test now asserts every entry resolves.
 *
 * Single source for the string markers, delivery-exclusion data, PM
 * extends-stub contract, and delivery-tree derivations shared by the two
 * scaffold paths (`scripts/create-l3-scaffold.ts`, `scripts/new-project.ts`),
 * the standing validators (`scripts/validate-templates.ts`), the parity
 * harness (`scripts/test-scaffold-delivery-parity.ts`), and the unit tests.
 *
 * Why this module exists: both scaffold scripts execute `main()`
 * unconditionally on import (they are CLI-only), so their inline constants
 * cannot be imported by tests or validators. T-20260915-002 (C3) additionally
 * requires one declarative home for the markers the scaffolders search for in
 * source templates — the graft-block injection once searched for a marker the
 * source file no longer carried, `indexOf` missed, and the block silently
 * never shipped (docs/reports/2026-09-15-project-review-template-fleet.md,
 * finding C3).
 *
 * Import-safety: this module has no side effects and performs no I/O at
 * import time (all reads happen inside functions), so validators and bun test
 * files can import it freely.
 *
 * Consumers:
 * - create-l3-scaffold.ts  — marker constants, L3_COMMON_OVERLAY_EXCLUDE
 * - new-project.ts         — NEW_PROJECT_* delivery constants, isCanonicalPmStubBody
 * - upgrade-project.ts     — VERSION_MANIFEST regeneration constants
 * - validate-templates.ts  — SCAFFOLD_MARKER_SOURCES (scaffold-marker-source
 *                            check), REVIEWED_DELIVERY_EXCLUSIONS helpers,
 *                            isCanonicalPmStubBody (pm-extends-stub-body check)
 * - test-scaffold-delivery-parity.ts / unit tests — derivations + diff
